<p>HyperText Markup Language <small>html</small> is a markup language used to create <strong>web pages</strong>. It was created in 1990 by <em>Sir</em>, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web.[1] Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like. </p>
<p>HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information.</p>
